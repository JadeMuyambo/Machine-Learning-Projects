# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains projects from **CSC646: Machine Learning** course from Fall 2025 demonstrating practical skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, model tuning, and performance analysis.
The projects demonstrate an understanding in the application of machine learning algorithms including K-means, PCA, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM/SVR, Neural Network and Backpropagation by using Python packages to develop these applications
